# 🔐 LockPay Vault

A deterministic escrow vault built with Anchor on Solana.

LockPay Vault allows:

- A sender to lock SOL for a receiver
- The receiver to claim the funds
- The sender to cancel if the funds are not claimed

This vault enforces a strict mutual exclusivity constraint:

Funds can only be claimed OR canceled — never both.

---

# 🚀 Overview

LockPay Vault is a minimal but secure escrow implementation designed to demonstrate:

- PDA-based custody
- Deterministic account derivation
- State-driven constraints
- Authorization enforcement
- Safe fund transfers
- Devnet deployment

Built using:

- Anchor Framework
- Solana Devnet
- TypeScript Test Suite

# 🧠 Unique Constraint Logic

Core invariant of the system:

claimed == false:
    - Receiver may claim
    - Sender may cancel

claimed == true:
    - Claim blocked
    - Cancel blocked

This guarantees:

- No double withdrawal
- No race condition exploitation
- Deterministic terminal state
- Secure escrow behavior

# 🏗 Architecture

## Accounts

### Vault (PDA)

Stores escrow state.

Fields:
- sender: Pubkey
- receiver: Pubkey
- amount: u64
- claimed: bool
- bump: u8

Seeds:
["vault", sender, receiver]

### Vault Authority (PDA)

Controls escrowed lamports.

Seeds:
["vault_authority"]

Used to securely hold funds during escrow.

## Program layout

The Anchor program is organized in a modular layout:

- `constants.rs` (PDA seeds, account sizing, minimum init amount)
- `errors.rs` (Anchor `LockPayError`)
- `state/` (account structs)
- `contexts/` (account validation / constraints)
- `instructions/` (handlers)
- `utils/` (shared helpers)

# 📜 Instructions

## initialize_vault

- Sender locks SOL
- Vault state initialized
- claimed = false

## claim

- Only receiver can call
- Transfers SOL to receiver
- Sets claimed = true

## cancel

- Only sender can call
- Transfers SOL back to sender
- Closes vault account

# 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite validates:

- Successful initialization
- Successful claim
- Successful cancel
- Prevention of double claim
- Prevention of cancel after claim
- Unauthorized access rejection
- PDA derivation integrity
- Balance consistency

Tests are split into two categories:

- Offline client tests (Jest) that validate transaction / instruction construction
- Integration tests (Anchor + ts-mocha) that execute instructions against a cluster
